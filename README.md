An index of all of my class projects from College

Here are some highlights:

CSCI230-Java2 - contains some basic java scripting that I did for class. It's a good example of where I started, although I haven't done much java since then.

CSCI332-Database Management - This class expanded my knowledge of SQL, PHP, and server administration.

CSCI340-Operating Systems - My first exposure to C. I enjoyed the class, especially what can be accomplished with the fork methods. There are some interesting scripts in here.

CSCI420-Compiler - Using loxical analyzers like FLEX, we examined how compilers and programming languages interact with machine assembly code.

CSCI440-Networking - This class, combined with my networking course in high school have given me the tools I need to earn my Net+ certification.

CSCI462-Practicum - As a group, we submitted several successful bugfixes to the XBMC opensource project.
