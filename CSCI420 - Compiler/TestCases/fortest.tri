//alrighty, so, breaking this down
-recognize for, from, to, do
-assign variables to X, then increase each variable through the loop.

grab "for"
-create variable X		//call it a constant, look at constant code
grab "from"
-assign x=6
grab "to"
compare x to 8 //maybe use a while loop, while X < 8
grab "do"
ACTION
x = x + 1
